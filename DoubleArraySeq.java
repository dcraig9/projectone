/******************************************************************************
* This class is a homework assignment;
* A DoubleArraySeq is a collection of double numbers.
* The sequence can have a special "current element," which is specified and 
* accessed through four methods that are not available in the bag class 
* (start, getCurrent, advance and isCurrent).
*
* @note
*   (1) The capacity of one a sequence can change after it's created, but
*   the maximum capacity is limited by the amount of free memory on the 
*   machine. The constructor, addAfter, 
*   addBefore, clone, 
*   and concatenation will result in an
*   OutOfMemoryError when free memory is exhausted.
*   <p>
*   (2) A sequence's capacity cannot exceed the maximum integer 2,147,483,647
*   (Integer.MAX_VALUE). Any attempt to create a larger capacity
*   results in a failure due to an arithmetic overflow. 
*
* @note
*   This file contains only blank implementations ("stubs")
*   because this is a Programming Project for my students.
